The Covid pandemic has shone a spotlight on the need to easily and quickly distribute donor funds to worthy / trusted recipients as food tokens. Although a multi faceted problem this project will tackle some aspects of solving the problems using block chain technology given certain simplifying assumptions.

There are 4 main roles in the process :
A = Donors : have funds available and want them to go to the needy
B = NGOs   : have on the ground connections with the needy
C = Retailers : Have food and are willing to supply it to token bearers, receiving payment from the donor funds
D = Recipients : Are in need of food and do not have funds to pay for it. They may or may not have a mobile phone, so for now they probably cannot be expected to own their own private keys to a crypto wallet.

**Simplified workflow on the website**
1. Donors will 
    1. register themselves 
    2. put funds into a donation contract
2. Retailers will register themselves as being willing to accept the tokens for food
3. NGOâ€™s will 
    1. register themselves 
    2. put lists of trusted recipients onto a donation contract (as mobile numbers or some for of identification card / passport)
    3. specify the value of each token for this donation contract and perhaps an expiry date 
    4. identify the retailer/s accepting redemption of the token for this donation contract
4. Once all donation contract criteria are met the contract will mint tokens for distribution. Examples of contract criteria in addition to the above are
   1. Recipients cannot be on multiple donation contracts within a specified time window
5. Distributing tokens is outside the scope of this project 
6. Unredeemeed tokens are returned to a new donation contract after expiry - also outside the scope of this project 

**Simplifying assumptions:** 
The basis of such a system is trust. This project will not definitively provide the ideal trust mechanisms necessary, but its worth describing them for completeness. 

Donors need to trust that the lists of recipients are not bogus. As such a trust building mechanism could be added to this process in the form of either
1. Additional third parties (teachers, community leaders etc) that have to vet the recipient lists. 
2. The NGO can only submit small lists of recipients initally; in other words the contract donation size for a new NGO is limited but can grow at a a given rate for each successful campaign completed (perhaps measured by redemption %)
3. The retailer could play a role in vetting that that the recipient that present themselves are indeed the intended recipients as per the NGO list

These additional trust mechanisms would be outside the scope of the project.
