In South Africa where I live the Covid pandemic has highlighted the need to easily and quickly distribute donor funds to worthy / trusted recipients as food tokens. Although a multi faceted problem this project will tackle some aspects of solving the problems using block chain technology given certain simplifying assumptions.

There are 4 main concepts in the donation manager process :
A = Donors        : Have funds available and want them to go to the needy
B = Donations     : A portion of the donor funds with some metadata.
                    A donors can make multiple donations
C = Distributors  : Have on the ground connections with the needy (Also called NGOâ€™s)
D = Distributions : Links a donation to a list of recipients and can be allocated funds of successful
                    A distributor can create multiple distributions
                    A distribution can only come from one donation

**Simplified workflow on the website**
1. Donors can
    1. register
    2. create a donation with Amount available for distribution, and how many USD per recipient per month they are willing to fund. $per recipient per month is a rough number since the contract runs int Eth. There is also an admin fee% to pay the distributor for distrubting tokens to recipients.
    3. deposit funds into the donation manager contract under the donor's address
    4. approve or deny funds to be sent to a distributor once conditions are met
    5. get their donation balances
    6. change the status of a distributor (To Trusted or UnTrusted).
    7. optionally withdraw any unused funds out of the donor's balance
2. Distributors can
    1. register
    2. create a distribution against a donation that has been funded
    3. request the funding from the donation for a specific distribution
    4. withdraw funds from the distributor's balance

Run Instructions
1. in one terminal window
    npx ganache-cli --deterministic
2. in a second terminal window
   npx truffle migrate --network development

   to recompile all
   npx truffle compile --all
  (npx?) truffle compile && mocha --exit --recursive

**Simplifying assumptions:**
The basis of such a system is trust. This project will not definitively provide the ideal trust mechanisms necessary, but its worth describing them for completeness.

Donors need to trust that the lists of recipients are not bogus. As such a trust building mechanism could be added to this process in the form of either
1. Additional third parties (teachers, community leaders etc) that have to vet the recipient lists.
2. The NGO can only submit small lists of recipients initally; in other words the contract donation size for a new NGO is limited but can grow at a a given rate for each successful campaign completed (perhaps measured by redemption %)
3. The retailer could play a role in vetting that that the recipient that present themselves are indeed the intended recipients as per the NGO list

These additional trust mechanisms would be outside the scope of the project.
